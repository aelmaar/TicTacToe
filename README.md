# TicTacToe
Building a simple TicTacToe game with C#/.NET Console\
Even if this game on the console but I tried to make it more functional (for exemple: if the player choose a character except X or O the program will ask him again to choose either X or O), I explain everything on the code, so you could understand it, and I hope you will have fun with it :)
